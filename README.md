<h2 align=center>Custom Image Classifiers for Object Detection and Facial Expression Recognition </h2>


In this project we implemented Image classifiers for The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) and Cohn-Kanade Facial Expres-
sions datasets.

The scope of the taska are summarised below:


* Developed custom image classifiers from scratch to detect objects from the SVHN and Cohn-Kanade facial expressions datasets.
* Implemented Adam and SGD optimizers, various non-linear activation functions (RELU, Leaky RELU), dropout, L1 and L2 regularisation techniques, backpropagation for neural network training, and appropriate loss functions (Cross Entropy for a multiclass setup).
* We evaluated the performance of the models with several metrics including, accuracy, F1-score, precision and recall. This metrics were implemented also from scratch.
* Demonstrated proficiency in building and training deep learning models for accurate object detection and facial expression recognition.
